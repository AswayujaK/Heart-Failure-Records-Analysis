# Heart-Failure-Records-Analysis
Data Visualization Project

◦ Aimed at analyzing and visualizing a UCI ML repo dataset about heart failures. Successfully pre-processed the dataset using python, identified potential dashboard users, formulated relevant questions for data exploration, and designed comprehensive visualizations to answer those questions.

◦ Utilized both Mural and Tableau platforms to design interactive dashboards presenting insightful visualizations and empowering data-driven decision-making
